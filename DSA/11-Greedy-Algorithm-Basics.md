# 11 - Greedy Algorithm Basics

## What is a Greedy Algorithm?
A Greedy Algorithm chooses the **best option available right now** at every step.

It does not usually go back and change the previous decision.

Simple idea:
```text
Choose the best local option -> move forward -> repeat
```

## Where Greedy is useful
Common examples:
- Activity Selection
- Coin Change for some coin systems
- Minimum/Maximum selection problems
- Kruskal's Algorithm
- Prim's Algorithm
- Huffman Coding

## Beginner Example - Activity Selection
Suppose we have activities with start and end times.
We want to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.

```text
Activity  Start  End
A1        1      2
A2        3      4
A3        0      6
A4        5      7
A5        8      9
A6        5      9
```

Greedy idea:
Choose the activity that finishes earliest.

## C# Example
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

class Activity
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Start { get; set; }
    public int End { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List<Activity> activities = new List<Activity>
        {
            new Activity { Name = "A1", Start = 1, End = 2 },
            new Activity { Name = "A2", Start = 3, End = 4 },
            new Activity { Name = "A3", Start = 0, End = 6 },
            new Activity { Name = "A4", Start = 5, End = 7 },
            new Activity { Name = "A5", Start = 8, End = 9 },
            new Activity { Name = "A6", Start = 5, End = 9 }
        };

        activities = activities.OrderBy(x => x.End).ToList();

        int lastEndTime = -1;

        foreach (Activity activity in activities)
        {
            if (activity.Start >= lastEndTime)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(activity.Name);
                lastEndTime = activity.End;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Coin Change Basic Example
Suppose coins are:
```text
10, 5, 2, 1
```
Amount:
```text
18
```

Greedy choice:
```text
10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 18
```

## C# Code
```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int amount = 18;
        int[] coins = { 10, 5, 2, 1 };

        foreach (int coin in coins)
        {
            while (amount >= coin)
            {
                Console.Write(coin + " ");
                amount = amount - coin;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Output:
```text
10 5 2 1
```

## Important Note
Greedy does **not** give the correct answer for every problem.
It works only when the problem has a valid greedy property.

## Time Complexity
It depends on the problem.
For Activity Selection, sorting usually takes:
- Time Complexity: **O(n log n)**

## Practice
1. Select maximum non-overlapping activities.
2. Solve coin change using greedy.
3. Find minimum number of notes for an amount.
4. Find maximum value by repeatedly choosing the largest available value.

# Detailed English Workbook

## Learning contract

This workbook develops a complete understanding of **Greedy Algorithms**.
It keeps the earlier lesson and code available above.
The added material uses English only.
Every solved problem includes a requirement, reasoning, C# solution, and dry run.
Read the sections in order on the first attempt.
On revision days, start with the problems and return to theory when necessary.

## Mental model

The central idea is to make the best valid local choice, record it, and continue without undoing earlier choices.
An algorithm is a precise sequence of finite steps.
Each variable must have one clear responsibility.
The input is the value supplied by the caller.
The working value is allowed to change during processing.
The result stores information already discovered.
A loop condition says when more work remains.
A return statement exposes the completed answer to the caller.
Keeping these roles separate makes debugging much easier.

## Before writing code

1. Write one concrete input and its expected output.
2. Identify invalid or unsupported inputs.
3. Decide whether the original input must remain unchanged.
4. Name the state that changes after every step.
5. State the loop invariant in one sentence.
6. Choose a stopping condition that must eventually become false.
7. Check zero, one, negative values, and boundaries where relevant.
8. Estimate time complexity before optimizing.
9. Estimate extra space separately from the input storage.
10. Only then translate the reasoning into C#.

## Reference implementation

```csharp
static int SelectActivities(List<(int Start, int End)> activities)
{
    activities.Sort((a, b) => a.End.CompareTo(b.End));
    int count = 0;
    int lastEnd = int.MinValue;
    foreach (var activity in activities)
    {
        if (activity.Start < lastEnd) continue;
        count++;
        lastEnd = activity.End;
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Reference implementation explained

- The method has a narrow purpose and can be tested independently.
- The parameter makes the method reusable for many inputs.
- Guard clauses deal with exceptional or impossible states early.
- Local variables describe the state of the current computation.
- The loop performs one safe unit of progress at a time.
- The update expression moves the algorithm toward termination.
- The final return value matches the method's declared result type.
- No console input is required inside the algorithm method.
- This separation lets a console app, API, or test call the same logic.
- The implementation favors readability before micro-optimization.

## Solved Problem 1: Greedy Algorithms case 1

### Requirement

Process the representative input `1` using the chapter algorithm.
Return or display the mathematically correct result.
Do not hide the logic inside an unrelated library shortcut.
Keep the algorithm in a separate method so it can be tested.

### Reasoning

1. Begin with the input `1`.
2. Apply the rule: make the best valid local choice, record it, and continue without undoing earlier choices.
3. Record state after every meaningful update.
4. Continue only while unprocessed work remains.
5. Verify the result against the definition, not merely the program output.

### C# solution usage

Use the reference implementation above with this call:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Case 1 input: 1");
```

### Detailed dry run

| Step | State inspected | Decision or calculation | Why it is correct |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | Input is `1` | Initialize method state | No input work has been processed yet |
| 1 | Inspect state after update 1 | Apply the next valid part of the algorithm | The invariant remains true after this update |
| 2 | Inspect state after update 2 | Apply the next valid part of the algorithm | The invariant remains true after this update |
| 3 | Inspect state after update 3 | Apply the next valid part of the algorithm | The invariant remains true after this update |
| 4 | Inspect state after update 4 | Apply the next valid part of the algorithm | The invariant remains true after this update |

## Common mistakes and corrections

### Mistake 1

Problem: Changing the original value before saving it.
Correction: Copy it when a later comparison needs the original.

### Mistake 2

Problem: Using an update that does not approach the stopping condition.
Correction: Prove that each iteration reduces remaining work.

### Mistake 3

Problem: Skipping zero and boundary inputs.
Correction: Write explicit tests for boundaries before normal cases.

### Mistake 4

Problem: Mixing console code with algorithm code.
Correction: Keep input/output in Main and logic in a method.

### Mistake 5

Problem: Returning from inside a loop too early.
Correction: Return only when the answer is logically complete.

### Mistake 6

Problem: Assuming sample output proves correctness.
Correction: Test normal, edge, invalid, and stress cases.

### Mistake 7

Problem: Ignoring numeric overflow.
Correction: Use checked arithmetic or a wider numeric type when needed.

### Mistake 8

Problem: Optimizing without understanding.
Correction: First create a correct baseline and measure later.

## Complexity analysis

Time complexity counts how the number of operations grows with input size.
Space complexity counts additional memory created by the algorithm.
A fixed set of scalar variables contributes constant auxiliary space.
A collection whose size grows with input contributes non-constant space.
Complexity does not replace correctness; it compares correct approaches.
For digit algorithms, let d represent the number of decimal digits.
For arrays, let n represent the number of elements.
For graphs, use V for vertices and E for edges.
State assumptions whenever the complexity depends on representation.

## Interview questions with concise answers

### Question 1: Why use a separate method?

It isolates one responsibility and makes testing straightforward.

### Question 2: Why preserve the original input?

Some algorithms must compare the computed value with the input.

### Question 3: What is a loop invariant?

A fact that remains true before and after every iteration.

### Question 4: How do you prove termination?

Show that measurable remaining work decreases toward a fixed bound.

### Question 5: What is an edge case?

A valid or invalid boundary input that behaves differently from common inputs.

### Question 6: Why discuss overflow?

Correct mathematical results may exceed the storage range of a C# type.

### Question 7: When is O(1) space accurate?

When additional storage stays fixed as input size grows.

### Question 8: Why dry-run code?

It exposes incorrect updates and conditions before execution.

### Question 9: What should be tested first?

The smallest meaningful case because its expected behavior is easiest to prove.

### Question 10: When should optimization begin?

After correctness is established and a real performance need is measured.
