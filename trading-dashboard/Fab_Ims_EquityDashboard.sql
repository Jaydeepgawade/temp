/*
Read-only dashboard; SQL Server 2016 SP1+ (CREATE OR ALTER).
Quarter keys are fixed-width YYYYMM with quarter-end month 03/06/09/12.
Result sets: 1 totals, 2 eight status cards, 3 quarters, 4 positions,
             5 RMs, 6 incentive types, 7 detail.
Status cards ignore @PStatus; all other filters and role restrictions apply.
Net = Incentive + AdjIncentive; FileAdjAmt is separate, as in original SP.
NISM expiry is a separate flag, not a replacement for workflow status.
No workflow updates/history inserts are performed.
