-- Manual acceptance checks with known test data:
-- 1. Totals equal the sums of detail monetary columns and each chart's totals.
-- 2. Eight status rows always appear, including zeros; sequence is 0,1,2,4,6,3,5,7.
-- 3. Two incentive types for one RM in the SAME quarter/status: RecordCount=2, RMQuarterCount=1.
-- 4. One RM in TWO quarters at the SAME status: TotalRM=1, RMQuarterCount=2.
-- 5. One RM-quarter with different statuses appears in both status cards. Do not sum distinct counts.
-- 6. A status outside the role's scope returns zero totals and no detail; cards stay role-scoped.
-- 7. FileAdjAmt appears separately and is NOT added to NetIncentive (matches original SP).
-- 8. Expired NISM is flagged in detail; financial/reporting status stays numeric and unchanged.
